                                <p>The story begins in the Shire, where Frodo inherits the One Ring from Bilbo Baggins.
                                     Gandalf discovers the Ring is the One Ring of Power, and Frodo, along with a fellowship
                                      of eight companions (Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, and Gandalf),

                                       a Balrog. The Fellowship then breaks, and Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor alone. </p>

                                     Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the Orcs who captured Merry and Pippin, while Rohan prepares 
                                     for war against Sauron's forces. The climax of this part is the Battle of Helm's Deep, a major
                                      conflict between Rohan and the forces of Isengard. </p>

                                The final part sees the culmination of the war against Sauron. Aragorn rallies the forces of 
                                Gondor and Rohan for a final stand against Sauron's army at the Pelennor Fields. Meanwhile, 
                                Frodo and Sam face their own trials in Mordor, battling Gollum and struggling against the Ring's 
                                corrupting influence. The Ring is eventually destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, leading to Sauron's 
                                defeat and the end of the War of the Ring. </P>
